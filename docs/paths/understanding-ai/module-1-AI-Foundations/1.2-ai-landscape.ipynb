    "- ✅ **AGI doesn't exist yet**: Despite hype, we're still years away from human-level general AI\n",
    "- ✅ **AI is everywhere**: Healthcare, finance, entertainment, transportation—every industry is transformed\n",
    "- ✅ **Different tools for different jobs**: NLP for text, CV for images, RL for decisions, etc.\n",
    "- ✅ **The tech stack matters**: ML → Deep Learning → Specialized applications\n",
    "- ✅ **Growth is explosive**: Generative AI grew 85% YoY in job demand\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 What This Means for You:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Narrow AI** for practical skills—that's what companies need NOW\n",
    "2. **Understand the limitations**—AI isn't magic, it's pattern matching\n",
    "3. **Learn the fundamentals**—they transfer across all AI technologies\n",
    "4. **Stay informed** on AGI developments, but don't hold your breath\n",
