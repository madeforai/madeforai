    "- ✅ **Three Learning Paradigms**: Supervised (with labels), Unsupervised (find patterns), Reinforcement (learn from rewards)\n",
    "- ✅ **Loss Functions**: Mathematical measure of how wrong predictions are (lower = better)\n",
    "- ✅ **Gradient Descent**: Iterative algorithm that finds optimal parameters by following the gradient downhill\n",
    "- ✅ **Learning Rate**: Controls step size—too small is slow, too large causes problems\n",
    "- ✅ **Train-Val-Test Split**: Essential for honest model evaluation and preventing overfitting\n",
    "- ✅ **Generalization**: The ultimate goal—models that work on NEW, unseen data\n",

    "### 🤔 The Big Picture:\n",

    "Machine learning isn't magic—it's systematic improvement through:\n",
    "1. **Defining a loss function** (what does \"wrong\" mean?)\n",
    "2. **Using gradient descent** (how to improve?)\n",
    "3. **Validating properly** (are we really getting better?)\n",
