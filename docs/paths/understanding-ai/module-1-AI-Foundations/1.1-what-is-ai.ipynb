    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You just built your first AI model. Let's recap what you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **AI vs Traditional Programming**: AI learns from examples, traditional code follows explicit rules\n",
    "- ✅ **History Matters**: AI has evolved over 70+ years from theory to everyday applications\n",
    "- ✅ **Types of AI**: Narrow AI (what we use today) vs General AI (the future goal)\n",
    "- ✅ **Machine Learning Workflow**: Data → Preparation → Training → Testing → Deployment\n",
    "- ✅ **Text to Numbers**: Computers need numerical representations to process text\n",
    "- ✅ **Real AI in Action**: You built a sentiment classifier that actually works!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Limitations to Remember:\n",
    "- Our model can't understand sarcasm or context  \n",
    "- It needs much more data to be production-ready\n",
    "- Simple bag-of-words ignores word order\n",
    "\n",
